I'm using the MCUFREIND_kbv library to read touch data from the screen. Every touch screen is different so some screen specific values needs to be set up.
The values are meassured/retreived with the TouchScreen_Calibr_native.ino sketch that comes with MCUFREIND_kbv

I needed to make a small change in the sketch so the touch was read on the correct pins (found with the diagnose_Touchpins sketch):
int XP=8, XM=A2, YP=A3, YM=9;

These are the values for my screen:

const int TS_LEFT=937,TS_RT=99,TS_TOP=72,TS_BOT=915;

PORTRAIT CALIBRATION     240 x 320
x = map(p.x, LEFT=937, RT=99, 0, 240)
y = map(p.y, TOP=72, BOT=915, 0, 320)

LANDSCAPE CALIBRATION    320 x 240
x = map(p.y, LEFT=72, RT=915, 0, 320)
y = map(p.x, TOP=99, BOT=937, 0, 240)
