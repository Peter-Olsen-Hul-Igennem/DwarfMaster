Midi controller for Mod Devices Dwarf

As no commercially avalible midi foot controller meet all of my requirements I have decided to build one myself.
This repository will hold source files and other documentation related to the build.
This is not ment to be a community project as the contoller is tailor to my specific needs, but all code is free to use by anyone doing a smililar project.

The controller is build with a Teensy 4.1 as the "brains". The Teensy is fitted with a MicroSD card for storrage of data.
The controller has a small touch screen that shows selected bank and patch and other relevant info. The "programming" of the controller is also done with the touch screen.
